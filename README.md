In this assignment, you'll implement a significant portion of the `ChunkyString` class you tested and wrote pseudocode for in Assignment 6.

# Reading
In addition to reading this assignment, we strongly recommend the following resources:
* In addition to your textbook (see, e.g., Sections 10.4-10.6 of the _C++ Primer 5th edition_), a really good source for information on STL algorithms is http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/ because it actually gives you code showing you how the algorithm works.  (Remember, though, that if you later decide not to use STL algorithms, you aren't allowed to copy from or adapt this code.) Unfortunately, some iterator functions aren't documented there, but the descriptions in your textbook and elsewhere are okay if you read them carefully.  Just keep iterator-invalidation issues in mind.
